## Description
  
  This is my portfolio showcasing my previous and current graphic design and web development work. Many of the web apps showcased were completed during my recent coding bootcamp (certificate earned October 2022) at the Ohio State University for Full-Stack Web development. The graphic design work shown below was mostly completed throughout the time since my graduation with a B.A. in Communications from OSU in 2018. A resume is also included listing my previous employment and a detailed list of projects completed.
